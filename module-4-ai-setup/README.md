## Two Options for Getting Started

### Option A: AWS Bedrock (School Login)

**Best for:** Students with UO credentials who want access to powerful models without local hardware requirements.

- ✅ Access to Claude, Llama, and other production-grade models
- ✅ No local GPU or RAM requirements
- ✅ Managed infrastructure—just focus on learning
- ⚠️ Requires UO SSO authentication
- ⚠️ Usage may be monitored/limited by school policies

[→ AWS Bedrock Setup Guide](./aws-bedrock/README.md)

### Option B: Local Setup (Ollama)

**Best for:** Students who want to run models on their own Mac for privacy, offline use, or experimentation.

- ✅ Complete privacy—data never leaves your machine
- ✅ No API costs or usage limits
- ✅ Works offline
- ⚠️ Requires 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- ⚠️ Limited to smaller models (7B-13B parameters)
