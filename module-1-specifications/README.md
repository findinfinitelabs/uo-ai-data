# Module 1: Data Specifications

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of data specifications in AI/ML projects
- Learn to define data requirements for healthcare datasets
- Create structured data schemas for health and dental records
- Establish data quality standards and validation rules

## Overview
This module introduces students to the foundational concepts of data specifications. Before collecting or creating data for AI training, it's crucial to define what data you need, how it should be structured, and what quality standards it must meet.

## Topics Covered
1. **Data Requirements Analysis**
   - Identifying necessary data fields for health/dental AI applications
   - Understanding data types and their appropriate use cases
   
2. **Schema Definition**
   - Designing data schemas for patient health records
   - Defining relationships between different data entities
   
3. **Data Quality Standards**
   - Completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness
   - Validation rules and constraints
   
4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Creating data dictionaries
   - Documenting data lineage and provenance

## Deliverables
- Data requirements document for a health/dental AI project
- Schema definition files (JSON/YAML)
- Data quality validation rules
- Data dictionary template
